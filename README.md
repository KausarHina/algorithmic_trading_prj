# algorithmic_trading_prj

The goal of this project is to show the time leveraging effect of using an exsiting 'sandbox' trading platform for testing strategies, machine learning models, backtesting and visualization vs doing all of the work in Jupyter Lab/VS Code.

We are plannning to choose 2 trading strategies and test them on the same data in 3 different machine learning models using Jupyter lab to find the model and strategy with the best return (will include backtesting and evaluation metrics and visualizations of results). The same strategies will be configured into the online trading bot FreqTrade using its commands to show the versatility and configuration options that are availble to traders with knowledge of python coding, financial strategies, and machine learning.


## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.8.9 with the following packages:

* [freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/) - free and open source crypto trading bot written in Python
